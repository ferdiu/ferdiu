# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Federico Manzella (a.k.a. ferdiu)

ðŸ§  **Ferdiu AI Solutions**
I'm planning to start my own business as a **freelancer**: [here](https://ferdiu.it) you can visit my website for more information about my services and projects.

ðŸ’¼ **Triple Role at IN MM S.r.l.**  
I am currently holding the triple role of **DevOps Engineer**, **Lead Developer**, and **AI Scientist** at [**IN MM S.r.l.**](https://inmm.co.uk), where I blend my expertise in development, operations, and artificial intelligence to drive innovative projects forward.

ðŸŽ“ **Symbolic Machine Learning Researcher**  
Currently working at [ACLAI Lab](https://www.unife.it/en) at the University of Ferrara, I specialize in **AI** and **Symbolic Learning**. My research spans **decision trees**, **temporal reasoning**, and **explainability in machine learning**.

ðŸŽ® **Indie Game Developer**  
When Iâ€™m not delving into the complexities of machine learning, Iâ€™m creating games! I enjoy building 2D games using **Godot** and crafting immersive 3D worlds with **Unity**. Check out some of my projects on [itch.io](https://ferdiu.itch.io/)!

## ðŸ”­ **Projects**

- **Symbolic Learning in Julia**: I'm passionate about using **Julia** for symbolic AI, as seen in my contributions to projects like [`Sole.jl`](https://github.com/aclai-lab/Sole.jl) and [SimpleCaching.jl](https://github.com/ferdiu/SimpleCaching.jl).
- **AI for Health**: My research is focused on using machine learning for health-related applications, including the analysis of audio recordings (such as breath and cough sounds) to detect COVID-19. This project has led to publications in *Artificial Intelligence in Medicine*.
- **Towards an Objective Theory of Subjective Liking**: Exploring the intersection of AI and aesthetics, I was working on this project to understand the subjective experience of beauty through machine learning. This research was published in *PLOS One*.

## ðŸ’¡ **Research Publications**
I've authored and co-authored several papers, including:
- **"Towards an Objective Theory of Subjective Liking"** - Exploring the sense of beauty. Published in *PLOS One*.
- **"The Voice of COVID-19"** - Applying machine learning to health data, published in *Artificial Intelligence in Medicine*.
